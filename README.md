A library for using gists. Written using
[wffi](https://github.com/greghendershott/wffi).

Requires Racket 5.3.2.2 or higher.

To install:
  * `git clone git://github.com/greghendershott/wffi.git`
  * `raco link wffi`
  * `git clone git@github.com:takikawa/racket-gist.git`
  * `raco pkg install racket-gist/`

This installs the `gist` and `gist-tool` collections.
The latter is a DrRacket tool that allows you to download
gists (and eventually more).
